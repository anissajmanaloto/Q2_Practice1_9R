    <p>Coding is one of the most intriquite modern things. It requires percise codes and percise eyes to see what went wrong. Overall, it was hard but fun to see how everything goes intro place one finished. If I had to describe it in one word, it would be challenging. Challenging since it was diffcult to properly put things into place.</p>
